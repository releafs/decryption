This contributes $0.0379 per cubic meter, saving 1,000,000 cubic meters of groundwater in 5 years. The MBBR recycling system, originally installed by UNICEF, has been enhanced by Hasar, a local climate action nonprofit, to run on renewable energy. This reduces carbon emissions by 131.4 metric tons annually and serves as a model for sustainable urban development, fostering public awareness and eco-tourism while enhancing water sustainability.",www.releafs.co,01.01.2025,Cubic meters,1125835,5,"Landscape Improvement:, Public Health Improvement, Ecosystem Improvement, Energy Saving, Community Engagement, Climate Resilience, Water Resource Conservation, Energy Efficiency and Sustainability","SDG11, SDG6, SDG7, SDG13, SDG3",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YxtCfZBm0q2-6s0V2qUydvGNrzmq0HRV/view?usp=sharing,01.01.2025,Hasar Organization,MoU,Not Yet,MRV,Not Yet,Impact Report
