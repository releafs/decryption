This project, financed by private investors, will provide clean, renewable energy to local businesses and residential sectors, reducing reliance on costly diesel generators. The solar farm, installed by Gemeni Co., operates on a modular design, connecting multiple consumers to the grid and saving $0.106 per kWh in electricity costs. Over 25 years, this project will prevent the use of over 25,000 metric tons of diesel, significantly lowering CO2 emissions and fostering sustainable energy practices in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq.",www.releafs.co,01.01.2025,Mw,12240,15,"Public Health Improvement, Energy Saving, Community Engagement, Climate Resilience, Energy Efficiency and Sustainability","SDG13, SDG7",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Dc25WbE4eXrHKEfzsk7V_e9S3nFmFrHC/view?usp=drive_link,01.01.2025,GridX,Mou,Not Yet,MRV,Not Yet,Impact Report
